# Infra-App

A simple infrastructure setup using **Terraform** to create and manage **Production**, **Staging**, and **Development** environments.

## Overview

This project helps automate the provisioning of isolated environments using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform. Ideal for teams or individuals looking to streamline their DevOps workflow.

## Project Structure

```

â”œâ”€â”€ production/      # Production environment configs
â”œâ”€â”€ staging/         # Staging environment configs
â”œâ”€â”€ development/     # Development environment configs
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/         # Reusable Terraform modules
â”œâ”€â”€ main.tf          # Main Terraform configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ backend.tf       # Remote state backend setup
â”œâ”€â”€ variables.tf     # Input variables
